        <p id="p-tag">The Wicked in Pink Motorcycle Run was developed by Bob Kaine Alves, owner of THROTTLE ROCKER NATION, to pay it forward to others battling cancer. During Bob's year-long battle with head and neck cancer in 2012, he received amazing treatment and came into daily contact with some of the most caring and compassionate staff at SR. CARITAS CANCER CENTER. Bob just knew that when he was healthy again, he would have to find a way to repay them for all they did and just saying thank you wasnâ€™t going to be enough. </p>
        
        <p id="p-tag">The event was created in 2013 and held on the Sunday before Columbus Day to show support for all types of cancer, but being that this is occurring in October, he chose pink for a color.</p>

        <p id="p-tag">The mission of the Wicked in Pink charity is to raise money for the SR. CARITAS CANCER CENTER Patient Services Fund to help with many of the financial burdens cancer patients may face, as well as show support for all those battling cancer, cancer survivors, as well as their caregivers, family and friends. That means we're putting money into the hands of the patients to help them with some of the expenses involved in going through treatment. That's direct and indirect expenses. Often, it's the latter that's the hardest hitting.</p>

        <p id="p-tag">If you can't make our yearly motorcycle run but would still like to help, there's a donate button below. Just click on it and you can make a donation using Paypal, a credit card or a debit card. We thank you for your support.</p>
