            The Sr. Caritas Cancer Center at Mercy Medical Center provides services to over one-third of all cancer patients in the Pioneer Valley area. The Sr. Caritas Cancer Center Patient Services Fund was established for the purpose of providing direct support to Cancer Center patients in dire financial need. This assistance will help patients cover unexpected expenses associated with their care. Direct Care Support does not include physician visits, hospital care or medical expenses. All applicants are reviewed on a case by case basis. This is a "last resort" fund for patients with meager assets and funds; much needed support for patients who may seek funds no more than two times per year.
